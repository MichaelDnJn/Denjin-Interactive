// INTRO //
- Afternoon, I’m Michael - @MichaelDnJn.
- I'm a studying software engineer in the penultimate year of my degree.

// ABOUT ME //
- I dabble a little in a lot, and I'm trying to fix that. 
- I love game programming and just programming in general - its just a good, fun way to spend my time. 
- Web development and website work is never dull to me, contrary to popular opinion.
- I follow a lot of fandoms from Anime/K-pop/K-dramas.
- My hobbies outside of code are very spaced out between dance, music(learning piano) and art(mostly sketches on paper, if not digital).

// WHAT I'M UP TO //
- I'm currently interning at a few places for software development, website development/design, graphics, etc.
- I'm also looking around for my major passion project for my final year thesis. 
- Right now, I'm thinking about maybe robotics, or something in the field of peripherals to bring the everyday workspace closer to that of Techmo or Tony Stark.
- Just some cool hologram or at the very least fully interactive and malleable digital workspace is the name of the game.
